/**
 * Internal-initiator admission tracking on v2 hosts.
 *
 * The v1 `chat.headers` hook decides whether the current provider request
 * carries an agent-initiated user message by fetching that message's parts
 * (part-level marker metadata). v2 has no `session.message` equivalent and
 * its transcript user messages are flat (`{id, text, metadata, ...}`,
 * message-level metadata), so the v2 bridge (`src/v2/setup.ts`) learns the
 * marker from in-band sources instead:
 *
 * - `session.prompt` admissions carry prompt `metadata` (the session-prompt
 *   bridge already reads the internal-initiator key) — recorded here at
 *   admission time;
 * - `session.synthetic` admissions bypass the prompt hook entirely and the
 *   host drops synthetic metadata from the LLM context envelope, so the
 *   client shim records the admission HERE, passing a client-chosen
 *   `msg_`-prefixed id the host honors (`Session.synthetic` accepts
 *   `input.id`) and preserves on the context message.
 *
 * The chat-headers bridge then matches the trailing user message id (learned
 * from context events, which fire before every `model.request`) against this
 * tracker — no per-request transcript round-trip.
 *
 * Bounded FIFO (mirrors the prompt bridge's session-map pruning): stale ids
 * from failed admissions simply never match a real context message.
