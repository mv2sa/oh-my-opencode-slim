/**
 * Terminal-observation handoff for background children re-prompted by
 * the foreground fallback (false-stop incident): the host's native task
 * notifier is bound to the original background job and never re-arms
 * for the re-prompted execution, so slim owns observing the
 * substituted run.
 *
 * Three-phase contract — the handoff brackets the fallback's
 * ADMISSION await instead of following it:
 *
 * - `prepare` runs BEFORE `promptAsync` is awaited (baseline in hand
 *   from the same transcript read that produced the replay). While the
 *   admission is pending, the stop-evidence gate DEFERS terminal
 *   publication (`isObservationPending`) — the job may already hold
 *   the re-prompted result, but no delivery owner exists yet, and
 *   publishing then would strand the result without a parent
 *   notification (the exact incident shape). Preparing also SUPPLANTS
 *   the previous publisher (its in-flight probe fences out).
 * - `admit` converts the preparation into a tracked run (register +
 *   immediate probe) once the host accepts the re-prompt — including a
 *   v2 `switched: false` delivery (prompt admitted on the current
 *   model is still admitted work).
 * - `reject` releases ownership on an EXPLICIT host refusal (error
 *   envelope, typed capability rejection): nothing was admitted.
 * - `settleUnresolved` handles unknown outcomes (transport failed
 *   without a response — the host may still have accepted the replay):
 *   the prepared ownership CONVERTS into a tracked run instead of being
 *   dropped. The gate fence lifts after one more expiry window if
 *   admit/reject never arrive; the owner stays.
 *
 * Guards: only confirmed BACKGROUND jobs (`background === true`,
 * `state === 'running'`) participate; the generation is REQUIRED (never
 * a wildcard) and must still match the board record at prepare time.
 * Expiry does not drop a pending preparation — it converts it into the
 * owning run, so a late admission finds delivery already owned.
