# src/hooks/task-session-manager/

## Responsibility

Manages V2 background job-board state for task execution and injected completion messages, enabling the orchestrator to track active jobs and reuse only completed, reconciled child sessions by short aliases (e.g., `exp-1`, `ora-2`). The implementation is split into focused submodules to improve separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Design

The directory follows a **Facade + Strategy** pattern where `index.ts` acts as the facade that composes and orchestrates behavior across specialized strategy modules:

- **index.ts**: Main facade that wires hooks into OpenCode's lifecycle and coordinates between the job board, pending calls, task context tracking, and explicit user waits. Implements the plugin hook interface (`tool.execute.before`, `tool.execute.after`, `experimental.chat.messages.transform`, `event`) and exposes `beginUserWait()` to the `wait_for_user` tool.
- **../../utils/background-job-terminal-gate.ts**: Shared execution/observation gate for every terminal publication. Runtime quiescence and attributable result evidence authorize one board commit; busy withdraws terminal publications. Grace, bounded retries and single-open reads are shared across adapters.
- **input-wait-tracker.ts**: Provides the single `hasInputWait()` seam used by idle reconciliation and continuation evaluation. It combines local question/permission waits with the process-global explicit user-wait latch.
- **continuation-attempt-gate.ts**: Owns process-global continuation epochs, reservations, and explicit user waits across hook recreation. The wait is encoded as an `attempts` sentinel so pre-upgrade #856 hooks sharing the store also fail closed. Distinct external user-message identity rearms both states.
- **continuation-model-selection.ts**: Normalizes current-session and chat-hook model shapes before forwarding runtime model and variant choices to idle continuation prompts.
- **pending-call-tracker.ts**: Tracks in-flight task calls using a capped ordered map (`MAX_PENDING_TASK_CALLS`) to correlate launch output safely. Provides call ID generation, storage, retrieval, and cleanup for pending task invocations.
- **admission-runtime.ts**: Re-exports the per-directory admission runtime
  lease used by plugin generations; its scheduler and pending-call tracker are
  torn down only after the final unclaimed owner release.
- **task-context-tracker.ts**: Manages read context from child sessions with line-count and file caps. Stores context per task ID and provides pruning to prevent unbounded growth.

All modules depend on `BackgroundJobBoard` from `src/utils/background-job-board.ts` as the single source of truth for active jobs, terminal unreconciled jobs, reusable completed sessions, aliases, read context, and LRU caps.

### Key Abstractions

- **BackgroundJobBoard**: Central state store for task sessions (active, reusable, terminal unreconciled).
- **PendingTaskCall**: Tracks in-flight task invocations with call ID, parent session ID, agent type, label, and optional resumed task ID.
- **ContextFile**: Represents read context from child sessions with path, line numbers, and last-read timestamp.
- **User wait**: Explicit text-only HITL latch armed by `wait_for_user` and released by a distinct real external user message.

## Flow

### Task Execution Lifecycle

1. **Before Execution (`tool.execute.before`)**
   - Intercepts `task` tool calls on managed sessions
   - Generates a task label from `description`/`prompt` via `deriveTaskSessionLabel`
   - Creates a `PendingTaskCall` record with call ID, parent session ID, agent type, and label
   - Resolves reusable task IDs from the job board; completed/reconciled jobs
     are reusable by alias, while timed-out running jobs become recoverable
     only after a live busy signal confirms they are safe to resume
   - If no reusable task exists, allows fresh task creation
   - Refuses a brand-new spawn whose objective exactly matches an
     unreconciled terminal job from the same parent and agent (dispatch
     loop guard, #1070); a `task_result` retrieval after that job's
     completion (`lastUsedAt > completedAt`) authorizes the retry

2. **Task Launch (`tool.execute.after`)**
   - Registers task launches in the job board with task ID, parent session ID, agent type, and description
   - Parses task output to extract task ID, status, or launch information
   - Adds read context to the job board for completed or terminal unreconciled tasks
   - Handles late-cancelled tasks by normalizing output and updating state accordingly

3. **Context Tracking**
   - Extracts read files from `read` tool outputs using `extractReadFiles`
   - Stores context per task ID in the task context tracker
   - Prunes stale context during lifecycle events and status transitions

4. **Message Injection (`experimental.chat.messages.transform`)**
    - Injects a `<system-reminder>` part containing the `### Background Job Board` section into user messages for managed sessions
    - Lists active, unreconciled, and reusable sessions
    - Remembers injected terminal jobs to reconcile them on the next request after the completion was surfaced to the model (via `reconcileConsumedTerminalJobs`)
    - The idle timer remains a backstop for when the model ends its turn without further requests; after reconciling injected terminal results, the opt-in continuation evaluator can run in the same idle cycle under its existing guards

5. **Lifecycle Events (`event`)**
    - `session.created`: Adds new task IDs to pending managed set. Early board registration claims a pending call only when it can be identified unambiguously: a unique child-session `title` match (the v2 host stamps `title = description` argument, additionally constrained to the child's agent) or a unique agent-type match among unmarked pendings **with no already-consumed same-agent call** — a no-title child arriving after a same-agent call's after-hook consumed its pending is treated as stale and never claims. Ambiguous, stale, or unattributable children get a placeholder `unattributed <agent> task` registration so task_status always resolves them; the owning `tool.execute.after` corrects the description. An already-registered child never fences a pending, and a pending's flags never cause `tool.execute.after` to drop the task ID parsed from its own output. On hosts that do not supply tool call IDs, `tool.execute.after` resolves identity via `takeByTaskID` — matching the task ID parsed from its own output against the pending the early registration claimed for that child — instead of guessing by insertion order among parallel calls; `take()` without a call ID only proceeds when exactly one pending exists for the parent. When neither identity source resolves but the call's own output carries a task ID, a guarded first-match drain fallback (`takeUnresolvedFirstMatch`) consumes the oldest eligible unmarked pending with a warning, so a parallel no-ID burst cannot strand unmarked pendings and poison the parent's future takes (a pending set consisting solely of marked pendings still refuses the fallback; each marked pending keeps its own owner-resolution path). Residual risk is bounded: unresolved-identity registrations (drain fallback and window-shifted sole takes, both flagged `identityUnresolved`) keep a generic description/objective — labels are never guessed; `resultSummary`/`taskID` always come from the call's own output. Admission tickets still bind to the registered task (fungible per agent/model bucket, totals correct; per-ticket attribution is unknowable in that window), and an evicted pending's ticket is released at eviction (pre-existing): capacity may under-count a still-running evicted task on no-ID hosts. Unattributed placeholder registrations whose owning after-hook never arrives may eventually be marked stopped by idle reconciliation and trigger the parent's stopped-job recovery wake, bounded by the two-wake no-progress cap.
    - `session.idle` / `session.status` (idle): Reconciles injected terminal jobs for the parent session (backstop path), then can run the opt-in continuation evaluator in the same idle cycle under its existing guards. Child idle is a stop candidate: the first observation stays provisional, and only a confirmed idle/absent after the 5s grace marks `stopped`
    - `session.status` (busy): Marks sessions as running from live session state and resets pending stop confirmation
    - `session.deleted`: Clears job state, child jobs, and pending call records for the session
    - `server.instance.disposed`: Clears generation-local state but leaves the
      shared pending calls and admission queue for the next generation

6. **Human-in-the-loop Waits**
   - `wait_for_user` calls the facade's `beginUserWait()` only after tool validation
   - The shared latch cancels pending continuation timers/reservations
   - Foreground-fallback replay provenance and shared fallback teardown state preserve the latch across plugin-manager recreation
   - Idle continuation remains suppressed until a distinct real user message arrives

### Data & Control Flow

```
User task call → tool.execute.before → PendingTaskCall created → task ID resolved/reused
→ tool.execute.after → BackgroundJobBoard.registerLaunch() → context extracted/added
→ Message transform → BackgroundJobBoard.formatForPrompt() injected as a system-reminder message part
→ session.idle → reconcileInjectedTerminalJobs() → BackgroundJobBoard.markReconciled()
→ opt-in continuation evaluator (same idle cycle, existing guards)
```

## Integration

### Consumers

- **Main Plugin (`src/index.ts`)**: Wires the task session manager hook into OpenCode's lifecycle via `createTaskSessionManagerHook()`.

### Dependencies

- **BackgroundJobBoard** (`src/utils/background-job-board.ts`): Central state store for task sessions and context.
- **Task Output Parsing Utilities** (`src/utils/index.ts`): `parseTaskIdFromTaskOutput`, `parseTaskLaunchOutput`, `parseTaskStatusOutput`, `deriveTaskSessionLabel`.
- **Guards & Logger**: `isRecord` utility and `log` for diagnostics.

### Configuration & Caps

- `maxSessionsPerAgent`: Limits reusable sessions per agent type
- `readContextMinLines`: Minimum lines to include in read context
- `readContextMaxFiles`: Maximum files to include in read context
- `shouldManageSession`: Predicate to determine which sessions are managed by this hook

### Events & Hooks

- `tool.execute.before` / `tool.execute.after`: Intercept task tool calls and register launches/status
- `experimental.chat.messages.transform`: Inject background job board status into user messages
- `event`: Handle session lifecycle events (created, idle, busy, error, deleted)

## Module Decomposition Rationale

The original monolithic module was split to improve:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Pending calls, task context, and job board state are now distinct responsibilities.
- **Testability**: Each module can be tested in isolation with focused contracts.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one concern (e.g., context tracking) do not affect unrelated logic.
- **Scalability**: Capped data structures prevent unbounded memory growth.

Each submodule adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle** while collaborating through the facade to provide a cohesive user experience.
