/**
 * Board → tui-state projection for the sidebar's reusable dot (#1197
 * follow-up). On every board mutation (set/delete/trim/drop — the
 * listener is intentionally payload-less), re-derive the latest
 * reconciled session per agent for every parent the board knows and
 * persist it into the snapshot's `reusableByAgent` section. The TUI is a
 * pure reader of this section; it never writes it.
 *
 * The board is the parent index (each record carries parentSessionID);
 * parents whose records are all gone drop out of the derivation. The
 * board is process-local, so this section must never be restored from a
 * stale file — the creation sweep clears it and the projection
 * repopulates from the live board.
 *
 * Cost: O(all jobs) per mutation. `updateSnapshot` early-outs when the
 * derived section is unchanged, so no-op mutations (e.g. heartbeat
 * status updates) never touch the filesystem.
