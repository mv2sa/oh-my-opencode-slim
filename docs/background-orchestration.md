# Background Orchestration

Background orchestration is the default orchestration model for
oh-my-opencode-slim. It assumes native OpenCode background subagents are
available and changes the orchestrator from a primary worker into a scheduler.

The old model was:

```text
orchestrator works directly → delegates when useful → waits for result
```

The default background-orchestration model is:

```text
orchestrator plans → dispatches background specialists → monitors → reconciles → verifies
```

This is a clean rebuild, not a compatibility layer over the old blocking model.

---

## Runtime Requirement

Background orchestration requires an OpenCode release that includes native
background subagents, launched with background subagents
enabled:

```bash
OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true opencode
```

The task API and background-control tools are:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `task(..., background: true)` | Start a specialist in the background and immediately return a task ID |
| hook-driven completion | OpenCode injects terminal background task results automatically |
| `task_status` | Check the status of a tracked task |
| `task_result` | Retrieve a tracked task's result |
| `task_message` | Queue a non-interrupting message and return `queued` |
| `task_cancel` | Stop a generation while retaining its session |
| `task_revive` | Resume a retained session with a new instruction |
| `wait_for_user` | Plugin-provided orchestrator tool that pauses automatic orchestrator wakes while the user performs external manual work |
| `outcome_control` | Authoritative outcome contract lifecycle, checkpointing, evidence attestation, review reconciliation, bounded progress/contract/action transitions, user decisions, external handoff completion, and final certification |

If these are not available, the scheduler cannot use the default background
workflow. Configure the environment variable through the installer or use the
one-shot export above before starting OpenCode.

Use an OpenCode release that includes native background subagents and hook-driven completion; run `opencode --version` and update if background tasks are missing.

---

## Core Principle

The orchestrator is not the default implementation worker.

Its job is to:

- understand the user request,
- break work into dependent and independent units,
- choose the right specialist for each unit,
- schedule background work,
- track task IDs and states,
- avoid conflicting writes,
- integrate specialist results,
- run or route final verification,
- communicate concise progress and outcomes to the user.

Specialists do the work. The orchestrator manages the work.

---

## Execution Loop

Every non-trivial request follows this loop:

```text
Understand
  ↓
Plan dependency graph
  ↓
Dispatch independent specialists in background
  ↓
Track task IDs and ownership
  ↓
Continue only independent coordination work
  ↓
Wait for hook-driven completion
  ↓
Reconcile results and resolve conflicts
  ↓
Dispatch follow-up work if needed
  ↓
Verify
  ↓
Final response
```

The orchestrator should not act on assumptions from a still-running task. It can
continue scheduling independent work, but dependent work waits for terminal task
results.

---

## Scheduler Responsibilities

### 1. Build a dependency graph

Before dispatching agents, the orchestrator identifies:

- which questions must be answered before implementation,
- which tasks can run in parallel,
- which tasks must be sequential,
- which files or subsystems each writer owns,
- which outputs are needed for final verification.

This does not need to be a long plan. It should be just enough structure to
avoid wasted work and conflicting edits.

### 2. Dispatch background specialists

Independent work should be launched with background tasks:

```text
task(
  description="Search auth flow",
  subagent_type="explorer",
  background=true,
  prompt="Find the auth entry points, session storage, and login callback paths. Return file paths and a concise map. Do not edit files."
)
```

The orchestrator records the returned task ID and keeps working only on safe,
independent coordination.

### 3. Track ownership

The scheduler must prevent write conflicts.

Rules:

- Only one write-capable specialist owns a file at a time.
- Do not run two `fixer` tasks against overlapping folders unless ownership is
  explicit.
- UI work that touches shared components should not run beside implementation
  work that edits the same components.
- Review tasks can run in parallel with read-only discovery, but not with edits
  they are supposed to review.

### 4. Wait, message, cancel, and revive

Background tasks are not complete until OpenCode injects their terminal result or
hook-driven completion marks them terminal.

The orchestrator should use background completion events to:

- wait for dependent results,
- check long-running tasks,
- collect outputs before final response,
- surface failures or blocked tasks clearly.

Use `task_status` to inspect a task and `task_result` to collect its result.
`task_message` queues a non-interrupting message and returns `queued`; it does
not stop the current generation. Use `task_cancel` to stop a generation while
retaining its session, then inspect and reconcile any partial file changes before
launching replacement work. Use `task_revive` to resume a retained session with a
new instruction.

A cancelled or errored retained session may be revived immediately once its
retained state has been verified safe. Acknowledgement controls parent and
job-board consumption and reusable-pool display, not same-session revival.

Terminal jobs are reconciled automatically after their result is injected into
the orchestrator session. That lifecycle state is not proof the output was used;
the orchestrator must still verify it consumed the relevant result before
finalizing.

To stop self-reinforcing acknowledgment loops, a brand-new `task` spawn is
refused while the parent still owns an unreconciled terminal job with the same
agent and an exactly matching objective. The refusal names the existing task ID
and directs the caller to `task_result`; once that result has been retrieved,
the same objective may be dispatched again for follow-up work.

Separately, the default-on orchestrator wake scheduler may prompt an
idle parent with incomplete todos after continuous idle time; it does not depend
on the local job board.

After a full OpenCode or plugin restart, persisted running background-task
history is rehydrated into the local job board and immediately reconciled
against live host session status. A missing child remains uncertain unless the
bounded final-result proof described below establishes completion for the
current run. An explicitly idle child becomes a stop candidate only after the
parent can accept terminal delivery and the configured confirmation interval
elapses. A busy child remains running, and status lookup failures remain
uncertain rather than being treated as completion.

Specialist outputs are inputs, not final truth. The orchestrator reconciles them
against each other and the original user goal.

### 5. Verify

Verification remains orchestrator-owned and should be proportionate to the
change. Use focused checks against the final state, broadening them only when
risk or uncertainty warrants it. Oracle review is conditional: dispatch it for
material semantic or architectural risk, unresolved uncertainty, or another
high-cost decision—not automatically.

The final response should only happen after relevant background work is terminal,
reconciled, and supported by final-state evidence.

---

## Specialist Roles

### Explorer

Read-only reconnaissance and codebase mapping. Usually the first background task
for unfamiliar work.

### Librarian

External docs, version-specific API behavior, and real-world examples. Runs in
parallel with Explorer when implementation depends on current library behavior.

### Fixer

Bounded implementation worker. Receives a clear objective, file ownership,
constraints, and validation expectations.

### Designer

User-facing UI/UX implementation and review. Owns visual polish, responsive
layout, interaction quality, and design consistency.

### Oracle

Architecture, code review, simplification, risk analysis, and high-stakes
debugging. Often used after implementation or before risky refactors.

### Council

Multi-model decision support for critical trade-offs. It is not a worker pool;
it is for judgment where disagreement is useful.

### Observer

Visual/media analysis isolated from the orchestrator context.

---

## Direct Work Boundary

Background orchestration removes the orchestrator-as-worker default.

The orchestrator may directly:

- ask clarifying questions,
- read minimal context needed to route work,
- create and update todos,
- launch and monitor tasks,
- synthesize results,
- run final checks when that is cheaper than delegating.

The orchestrator should delegate:

- broad code search,
- unfamiliar library research,
- implementation,
- test creation or updates,
- UI polish,
- architecture review,
- visual/media analysis.

This keeps the main context focused on coordination instead of filling it with
worker detail.

---

## Task Prompt Contract

Every delegated task should be self-contained.

Include:

- objective,
- constraints,
- relevant files or search scope,
- ownership boundaries,
- expected output format,
- whether edits are allowed,
- validation to run or report,
- what not to do.

### Task-fit rejections

If a task is outside a specialist's role, it must not attempt partial work. It
returns a brief reason to the orchestrator.
The orchestrator treats that reason as routing input to reroute or clarify the
task and must not retry the unchanged task with the same specialist.

Good background task prompt:

```text
Investigate src/hooks/task-session-manager for assumptions that a task tool
result means the child task has finished. Do not edit files. Return:
1. exact files/functions involved,
2. which assumptions break with background tasks,
3. recommended code changes,
4. tests that should be added.
```

Bad background task prompt:

```text
Look into background tasks.
```

---

## State The Orchestrator Must Track

The prompt/runtime treats background tasks as a small job board:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| task ID | Native OpenCode background task/session ID |
| specialist | Agent type assigned |
| objective | What the task is responsible for |
| state | running; stopped (runtime ended without terminal task output); completed, error, or cancelled (explicit terminal task output); reconciled (terminal result consumed) |
| ownership | Files/folders/subsystems the task may edit |
| dependencies | Tasks that must complete first |
| result | Final task output once terminal |
| status certainty | `status uncertain` when the live status map is malformed or unavailable; it never implies completion |

Cancelled and errored sessions can remain retained for a later `task_revive`.
They may be revived immediately once their retained state has been verified safe.
Acknowledgement controls parent and job-board consumption and reusable-pool
display, not same-session revival.

The current todo list can represent user-visible work, but task IDs and file
ownership need to be explicit in the orchestrator's working context.

---

## Runtime Integration

The plugin is aware that a `task` return can mean "background job launched"
rather than "work complete". It tracks running task IDs, exposes recent work in
the background job board, updates aliases from task results, and keeps
multiplexer panes attached while the parent orchestrator continues scheduling.

### Orchestrator wake scheduler

When an orchestrator parent stays continuously idle, the plugin may send a
periodic internal wake prompt so incomplete TODOs are not abandoned. This is
**enabled by default** with a **5-minute** interval:

```jsonc
{
  "backgroundJobs": {
    "orchestratorWake": {
      "enabled": true,
      "intervalMs": 300000
    }
  }
}
```

`intervalMs` must be an integer from `60000` to `2147483647`. `0` is invalid.
Set `enabled: false` to disable wakes while keeping idle reconciliation and
background-job orchestration.

Behavior:

- Per-session recursive `setTimeout(...).unref()` after continuous parent-idle
  time (never a global interval).
- Only sessions known as the parent `orchestrator` via session metadata.
- Host client APIs are authoritative (`session.get`, `todo`, `children`,
  `status`, `promptAsync` with the nested directory request shape). The local
  Background Job Board is never read or used as a gate.
- Wake requires valid host response shapes, parent currently idle, and at least
  one TODO with status `pending` or `in_progress`. Unknown/malformed status
  fails closed. **Active children do not suppress a wake.**
- Suppress/clear on question/permission input waits, `wait_for_user`, foreground
  fallback, session busy, session deletion, external user messages, and server
  disposal.
- One in-flight evaluation/wake per session. Status/waits/generation are
  rechecked immediately before `promptAsync`. Cooldown/reservation is recorded
  before the call so a failed `promptAsync` cannot storm retries.
- Default-on safety: the scheduler evaluates a bounded host-progress fingerprint
  (TODO statuses plus child status/update evidence) to decide whether to keep
  waking. After **two** successful wakes with an unchanged fingerprint, further
  wakes stop for that continuous idle spell. A real external user message or
  host-observed progress re-arms the cap. Busy caused by the wake itself does
  **not** rearm the cap; unrelated busy/error lifecycle events do. The wake
  prompt text is static and does **not** include a fingerprint or snapshot.
- Static wake text (internal initiator part via `promptAsync` only — no message
  transform injection or history rewrite):

```text
<system-reminder>
Finish any incomplete TODOs. Await running agents; if one appears stuck, assess it and cancel/respawn only when justified. Do not respond to this reminder.
</system-reminder>
```

The scheduler does **not** perform automatic cancellation and does not rely on
the local job board. When no incomplete TODOs remain, it ends the current idle
spell and stops polling until new activity.

**v2 availability:** the v2 shim lacks the required session APIs, so this
capability-gated feature remains inactive there.

For external manual work, the orchestrator first gives the user concrete steps,
then calls `wait_for_user` as its final tool action. This explicit signal covers
text-only HITL turns without attempting to infer intent from assistant prose. The
wait remains armed across hook/plugin recreation in the same process and is
cleared only by a distinct real external user message or genuine session
deletion. Re-observing the user message that preceded the wait, synthetic/internal
messages (including foreground-fallback replays), fallback teardown, session
errors, and idle/busy events do not clear it. Immediate choices, clarifications,
and pasted command output continue to use the `question` tool. If
`wait_for_user` is intentionally listed in `disabled_tools`, the orchestrator
uses the `question` tool as the blocking boundary instead.

For a managed outcome, restarting the OpenCode process is an explicit external
handoff rather than ordinary shell work. The orchestrator must first call
`outcome_control(action: "external_handoff", handoffKind:
"restart_current_opencode", ...)`, give the user the restart instructions, and
stop. As a narrow pre-execution guard, managed-root `bash` calls reject literal
current-OpenCode-PID termination and explicit `pkill`/`killall`/`systemctl`/
`service` restart commands that name OpenCode. Unrelated process and service
commands remain permitted. This is intentionally recognizable-form detection,
not shell analysis: aliases, wrapper scripts, substitutions, pipelines, and
other obfuscated or indirect restart forms are outside its scope.

The durable lifecycle has explicit exits rather than generic record mutation:

- `update_goal_status` may only move a named goal to `satisfied`; goal status is
  mutable progress and is excluded from the contract identity digest.
- `revise_contract` validates the complete replacement contract. Objective or
  scope changes require a later durable user-message receipt whose host message
  ID is included in the revised contract's `sourceMessageIds`.
- `resolve_action` requires a reason plus durable user or evidence provenance.
  Controller-owned recovery transitions, such as uncertain-checkpoint
  reconciliation and interrupted-operation acknowledgement, record their own
  explicit reconciliation provenance.
- `complete_external_handoff` requires a user receipt created after the handoff
  and a later fresh, passed attestation matching the expected post-restart
  check. Until then, the durable external wait remains active.

`begin` and `checkpoint` results expose only non-secret checkpoint identity and
`dispatchNudgePending`. The raw claim token and token-bearing Manager dispatch
instruction are emitted exclusively through the tagged trailing volatile
message transform; they are never serialized in ordinary tool output.

External user turn receipts are recorded in the durable outcome store with
whole-message provenance validation. If ANY authoritative part in a message turn
is synthetic, internal initiator, compaction continuation, or carries plugin
internal metadata, the entire message is rejected and mints no user message
receipt. Transformed `output.parts` are authoritative over cleaner `input.parts`
when present. Host message IDs are required, and duplicate host events with the
same message ID are idempotent no-ops. Literal marker text in ordinary user text
without synthetic metadata remains ordinary external user text.

On authoritative session idle (`session.idle` or `session.status: idle`) without
active background child tasks, leftover running tool operations from the current
server epoch are atomically reconciled to `interrupted` in the durable outcome
store (with reason `Session became idle without a durable tool after-hook`)
without fabricating success or creating spurious action noise. Repeated idle
events are idempotent no-ops that produce no revision growth or byte mutation.
Interrupted and failed operations remain visible in outcome status, and recovery
nudges direct the orchestrator to acknowledge them via
`outcome_control(action: "acknowledge_operation")`. Active child tasks suppress
idle operation reconciliation until child execution reaches a terminal state.

Outcome Manager dispatch uses its checkpoint claim as the durable operation
boundary. A reservation that later fails task-session preflight is retired
immediately and does not leave a generic running operation or require a process
restart to recover. A successful native launch is bound exactly once to its
task ID and board generation. Manager-result consumption is retry-safe only for
that exact `(root session, task ID, generation)` after completed reconciliation;
a different parent, generation, or terminal outcome is rejected.

### Successor Outcomes

Once an outcome is accepted and certified, its durable record and certificate
remain byte-for-byte immutable. Later external user messages continue through
normal orchestration without altering the prior certificate.

- Ordinary post-accept dialogue and tool calls proceed without mutating the
  accepted predecessor.
- The first eligible external user message after acceptance creates a durable
  pending generation N+1 intake, linked backward by predecessor outcome ID,
  generation, accepted revision, and domain-separated certificate digest. Later
  eligible messages append idempotently to that intake.
- When the user requests further non-trivial work, the orchestrator begins a
  governed successor outcome via `outcome_control(action: "begin", contract: ...)`.
  This promotes the pending intake in place to an active successor generation,
  preserving user receipts and establishing explicit backward lineage.
- Bounded session manifest (`<sessionHash>.manifest.json`) routes to the active
  generation and tracks pending successor intake; historical generations
  (`<sessionHash>.json`, `<sessionHash>.gNNNNNNNN.json`) remain accessible for
  read-only inspection.
- Retained history & no-GC policy: all accepted historical generation records
  are retained permanently on disk; no deletion or garbage collection is performed.
  The manifest is the sole authoritative routing source for active work.
  Missing historical records fail closed across the entire generation chain,
  as full lineage auditing is an explicit invariant.

### Background Job Board Injection

By default, each prompt uses the `latest` board strategy. The hook removes prior
metadata-tagged board messages and injects the current board snapshot, preserving
the existing strip-and-replace behavior.

For checkpoint-oriented workflows, opt in to the append-only strategy:

```jsonc
{
  "backgroundJobs": {
    "strategy": "checkpoint-compatible",
    "maxRetainedSnapshots": 20
  }
}
```

`checkpoint-compatible` preserves prior board snapshots and appends a snapshot
anchored after the current real-message tail only when the formatted board
changes. Once created, snapshots are replayed on every managed turn, including
turns with an internal initiator or an empty board; those turns do not create a
new snapshot. Re-running injection with an unchanged board does not create a
duplicate. This changes board message history only; task coordination, storage,
terminal reconciliation, and reusable-session behavior remain unchanged. The
retained snapshot cache is in memory, is limited to 20 snapshots per cache epoch,
and is reset when OpenCode reports a session boundary or a compacted/rebased
message history. `maxRetainedSnapshots` controls
the epoch size and accepts integers from 1 to 100 (default `20`). When a changed
snapshot would exceed the configured limit, all retained snapshots are discarded
and only the new current snapshot is kept. This intentionally creates one cache
miss at the epoch boundary, after which a fresh run of up to the configured limit
can accumulate. The cache is lost on plugin restart, so snapshots are not
restored beyond those present in the current OpenCode message history.

### Runtime Liveness Reconciliation

The job board is a local projection; OpenCode's live session-status map is the
liveness authority. After a tracked task launches, the plugin periodically
checks that single map for every board job still marked `running`, while normal
session events remain the fast path.

`busy` and `retry` confirm that a job is live and reset any pending stop
confirmation. Absence from an otherwise valid status map is uncertainty only
and never starts or advances the stop clock. For each missing running job, one
bounded child-result probe may run per reconciliation pass; probes are isolated
so a hung child does not block later jobs. The probe proves completion only when
the final message is a completed, error-free assistant turn with non-whitespace
visible text and a completion timestamp at or after the current run/liveness
boundary. Reasoning text is excluded, and only trimmed visible text is stored.
The tracked state and generation are revalidated after the probe await, while a
newer same-generation busy observation defeats older terminal evidence. Probe
errors, timeouts, and missing, empty, reasoning-only, or nonterminal results
leave the job running and status-uncertain. An explicit child `idle` state is a
stop candidate, but positive parent `busy` or `retry` is a terminal-delivery
barrier: while the parent is active, the child remains running and any pending
stop clock is cleared. After the parent becomes non-active, a fresh child-idle
observation starts `backgroundJobs.stopConfirmationMs` (default 30 seconds,
range 5–300 seconds). Repeat explicit-idle evidence after that interval records
`stopped, unreconciled` rather than `completed`: execution appears to have ended
without a native terminal task result. Stopped sessions are never reusable and
stay visible to the parent for recovery. A later live child `busy` observation
can revive an unreconciled stopped job. After the parent has been woken and the
stop acknowledged, stale busy cannot flip the job back to running. Only explicit
terminal task output or the narrowly fenced missing-session proof above proves
completion; explicit task output remains the only proof of error or cancellation.
Explicit busy/retry/idle/malformed/error status-map behavior is otherwise
unchanged.

Malformed status entries and failed status requests are surfaced as `status
uncertain`; they never prove that a job stopped or completed and do not confirm
a pending stop. Each observation is generation-aware, so a delayed response
cannot modify a relaunched task.

### Background Task Concurrency

`backgroundJobs.concurrency` (disabled by default, see
[Configuration](configuration.md#background-job-management)) caps how many
native background tasks may run at once. Admission happens in the
`tool.execute.before` hook: a task waits for a slot before OpenCode creates
its child session. Queued requests are admitted in order, but requests whose
resolved cap is saturated are skipped in favor of admittable later requests.

Only the most specific configured cap applies to a task: a model cap wins
over a provider cap, which wins over the default cap. `0` means unlimited.
So `modelConcurrency: {"openai/gpt-4o": 10}` permits 10 concurrent
`openai/gpt-4o` tasks even when `defaultConcurrency` is lower; other OpenAI
models fall back to `providerConcurrency` (or the default) instead.

The scheduler keeps its accounting correct across two runtime events:
- A task that switches models mid-flight (foreground model fallback or a
  runtime `/model` change on the child session) moves its provider/model
  accounting to the new model instead of keeping the admission-time model.
- The scheduler is process-scoped, so a plugin re-init (the plugin factory
  re-runs on config updates) preserves both running slots and queued
  tickets. Deleting a parent orchestrator also releases its children's
  admission slots, so capacity is never leaked by recursive-delete ordering.

Sessions that are themselves managed tasks — a background subagent running
its own nested `task(..., background: true)` calls — are exempt from
admission. They already hold a slot while running, so waiting for a second
one would self-deadlock once the queue saturates.

Admission itself has no timeout. A running task that never reaches a terminal
state keeps its slot forever, and queued tasks as well as the orchestrator's
`task` calls block behind it. When you enable `concurrency`, pair it with the
opt-in wall-clock supervisor below so stalled tasks are eventually forced to
a terminal state and release their slots.

### Opt-in Wall-clock Supervisor

The plugin can apply a one-shot wall-clock deadline to native background task
child sessions. It is disabled by default:

```jsonc
{
  "backgroundJobs": {
    "wallClockTimeoutMs": 900000,
    "abortGraceMs": 10000
  }
}
```

This supervisor recognizes only an explicit `task(..., background: true)` call.
Foreground tasks and calls where `background` is omitted or `false` are not
supervised. The deadline begins at the first launch observation for the current
run. Duplicate `session.created`/tool-hook observations, busy activity, tool
activity, and liveness timestamps do not renew it. An explicit relaunch or reuse
starts a new run generation.

When the deadline wins a race with a real terminal transition, the board records
a persistent hard-deadline marker, marks cancellation as requested, starts the
bounded abort grace period, and issues exactly one native session abort. The
grace timer is independent of whether the SDK abort resolves, rejects, or hangs.
An error, cancellation, or child deletion during grace publishes one stable
timed-out terminal outcome. If no terminal confirmation arrives before grace
expires, the outcome is `error`, `timedOut: true`, and `statusUncertain: true`,
with a summary stating that abort was not confirmed.

Late completion, busy, retry, or error events cannot replace a published hard
timeout, and a hard wall-clock timeout is not recoverable through the existing
external task-wait timeout path. The timeout outcome remains visible to the
parent through the normal terminal-unreconciled Background Job Board flow; no
prompt or raw task-result rewrite is used. Timeout terminals also issue a
permanent logical pane-close intent so generic and cmux multiplexer paths do not
respawn a pane on late busy events.

`wallClockTimeoutMs` accepts `0` or integers from `60000` through `2147483647`;
`abortGraceMs` accepts integers from `1000` through `60000`. This feature is
wall-clock-only: no no-progress/plateau policy, foreground fallback, model swap,
session deletion retry, or worker-death guarantee is implied.

### Antigravity Synthetic Quota Fallback

When Antigravity auth returns quota exhaustion via HTTP 200/STOP with 0 input tokens,
the plugin identifies the failure via a positive gate (model `google/antigravity-*`,
input tokens exactly 0, finish `stop`, no assistant error, and exact anchored template match).
Rather than establishing the quota text as canonical task completion, the plugin:
- marks a durable cooldown for the failed model matching the parsed reset interval (capped at 5 hours),
- rewrites false completion task outputs/injected completions to the byte-stable running placeholder,
- continues execution on the affected agent's configured model ladder via non-aborting continuation prompts,
- fences continuation transport with a bounded caller wait and mutual-exclusion message/control lease so slow transport does not block callers while preventing premature error classification or duplicate dispatches,
- enforces a hard transport quarantine deadline that releases the message lease, records incident deduplication, marks the running job's status uncertain with an explicit diagnostic, and skips model consumption if transport remains unresolved,
- handles late transport resolutions safely: post-quarantine acceptances are ignored locally (no model ladder progression, tracker registration, or newer-generation mutation) because host session abort cannot safely target only the abandoned request, and late transport errors do not overwrite quarantine state or terminalize the uncertain job,
- commits model ladder progress and registers with `RevivedRunTracker` upon transport acceptance,
- tracks the replacement run through `RevivedRunTracker` so the real replacement result is delivered once to the parent orchestrator,
- surfaces terminal error state if the fallback chain is exhausted or recovery cannot start.

---

## Startup Behavior

The installer and docs configure background subagents as a requirement for the
default scheduler workflow. If background subagents are
unavailable, treat it as an environment or OpenCode-version issue rather than an
intentional V1 fallback:

```text
Background orchestration requires OpenCode background subagents.
Start OpenCode with:

OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true opencode
```

No automatic legacy fallback keeps the mental model clean.

---

## Example Flow

User asks:

```text
Make background subagents first-class in this plugin.
```

The orchestrator should do something like:

1. Create todos for discovery, design, implementation, docs, tests, and
   verification.
2. Launch Explorer in background to map task-session hooks and task lifecycle.
3. Launch Oracle in background only if the change has material semantic or
   architectural risk or unresolved uncertainty.
4. Continue by preparing the dependency graph and file ownership plan.
5. Wait for the launched specialists via hook-driven completion.
6. Dispatch Fixer to implement prompt/config/hook changes with clear ownership.
7. Dispatch a second Fixer for tests if file ownership is separate.
8. Wait for implementation results.
9. Reconcile the implementation and dispatch Oracle only if remaining risk or
   uncertainty makes independent review worthwhile.
10. Run proportionate checks against the final state.
11. Report final state.

At no point does the orchestrator become the main implementer.

---

## Success Criteria

Background orchestration is working when:

- the orchestrator launches independent specialists in background by default,
- task IDs are tracked until terminal state,
- dependent work waits for real task results,
- file ownership prevents concurrent write conflicts,
- final responses only happen after reconciliation and verification,
- users see faster progress on multi-step work,
- the orchestrator context stays focused on decisions instead of worker detail.

Background orchestration is not just "parallel agents." It is a
scheduler-centered operating model for OpenCode's native background subagents.
